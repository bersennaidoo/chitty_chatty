# Problem Solving Process

    1. Gather information with respect to users and software system.

    2. Model information to explore relationships.

        2.1 Create a process model from the backend systems perspective thats shows
            the business processes and the activities within.
        
        2.2 Create a data model from the database systems perspective thats
            shows the data thats going to be tracked.

        2.3 Create a information architecture model from the users perspective thats shows
            the pages and their relationships.

    3. Choose a fragment of the information architecture that relates to
       the process model thats relates to the data model and implement the models which equates
       to a vertical slice, and do the same for the rest of the model fragments through multiple 
       iterations, and then you should have a complete working system.
