# Web Design

## Discovery
    
    Gather information about content and purpose of site.

    - Interviews
    - Observation
    - Documentation
    - As is site

## Models

    - Brainstorm ideas for title/theme that communicates content and purpose of site which will
      be used as the root of your IA, and for your logo.

    - Brainstorm ideas for visual metaphors to re-enforce title/theme: Color, Graphics, design elements.

    - Create a information architecture to categorize information and their relationships, and to discover
      navigation.

    - Design layout based on IA: wireframe

    - Evolve wireframe to a full blown mockup with visual metaphors.

    - Brainstorm scenarios base on usecases. eg: purchase product: alice clicks on the product page, and looks
                                              for a product to purchase.

## Implementation

      MVC framework of choice for backend eg: Ruby On Rails
